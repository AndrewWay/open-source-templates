      <h2>The Overflowing Inbox</h2>
      <img src="img/alice25a.gif">
      <p>You are standing in an open field west of a white house. The house is a carefully constructed masterpiece, with solid foundations and a beautiful facade matched by an elegant interior.</p>
      <p>In fact, the house is such a masterpiece that an endless line of volunteers has taken the time to help you improve upon it.</p>
      <p>There are two mailboxes here.</p>
      <p>The first mailbox is simply labeled <em>issues</em> ("as if I don't have enough of those to deal with", you think to yourself).</p>
      <p>The second is mysteriously labeled <em>Pull Requests</em>.</p>
      <p>Both are overflowing.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To organize the <em>issues</em> box, <a href="#" class="page-turner" data-target-page="37">turn to page 37</a>.</li>
        <li>To organize the <em>pull requests</em> box, <a href="#" class="page-turner" data-target-page="75">turn to page 75</a>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Bottomless</h2>
      <img src="img/451px-Maelstrom-Clarke.jpg">
      <p>You take a deep breath and open the box labeled <em>issues</em>.</p>
      <p>The size of the box surprises you. As you look into it, you are suddenly gripped by a feeling that the box has no bottom.</p>
      <p>As you stare down into the seemingly bottomless pit of the box, you begin to feel a chill running down your spine. It is as if… as if the endless box of issues is staring right back into your soul.</p>
      <p>It feels judgy.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rolling up your sleeves, you decide to take charge of the <em>issues</em> box and <a href="#" class="page-turner" data-target-page="38">turn to page 38</a>.</li>
        <li>Fear overtakes you. You close the box with a high pitched yelp and <a href="#" class="page-turner" data-target-page="1">turn back to page 1</a>.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

      <h2>Angels and Demons</h2>
      <img src="img/angelsversusdemons.png">
      <p>As you reach down into the box, a strange order begins to form. You start to notice patterns in the issues.</p>
      <p>Some take the form of <em>bug reports</em>, grey festering blobs of infinite malevolence. Others manifest themselves as great ethereal balls of living energy in the form ideas for <em>features, improvements and changes</em>.</p>
      <p>You furrow your brow as you consider concentrating on one type of issue, or both.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You decide to focus on <a href="#" class="page-turner" data-target-page="39">bug reports</a>.</li>
        <li>You decide to priorize <a href="#" class="page-turner" data-target-page="39">new features, improvements and changes</a>.</li>
        <li>You decide to accept both <a href="#" class="page-turner" data-target-page="39">bug reports and proposals for new features, improvements and changes</a>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Two Sides to Every Schwartz</h2>
      <img src="img/2book18.jpg">
      <p>As you pull your head out of the <em>issues</em> mailbox, you are startled by a voice coming from behind you.</p>
      <p>"So… what are you?"</p>
      <p>They are standing under a tree, each with an arm round the other’s neck, and you know which is which in a moment, because one of them has <em>`front’</em> embroidered on his collar, and the other <em>`back.’</em></p>
      <p>"I'm sure I'm very sorry, but whatever do you mean?"</p>
      <p>"There are two sides to every Schwartz," says the first. "Front end…"</p>
      <p>"…and back end," adds his brother.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>"<a href="#" class="page-turner" data-target-page="42">My project runs in the browser</a>" you say, giving <em>back</em> a mistrusting look.</li>
        <li>"<a href="#" class="page-turner" data-target-page="42">I am all about the server</a>" you say with some pride.</li>
        <li>You roll your eyes at the twins and say "<a href="#" class="page-turner" data-target-page="42">How quaint. Actually my code runs equally well on the server, as well as the browser</a>".</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>An Unexpected Guest</h2>
      <img src="img/cheshire_cat.png">
      <p>The brothers nod with understanding, give each other a knowing look and dissappear into thin air.</p>
      <p>"Ohh well," sighs a voice from the tree above, startling you.</p>
      <p>You look up just in time to see The Creature's grin widen at your fright. You notice with alarm that it has very long claws and a great many teeth.</p>
      <p>"Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?" you ask.</p>
      <p>"That depends a good deal on where you want to get to," says The Creature.</p>
      <ul>
