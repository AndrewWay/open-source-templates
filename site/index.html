      <h2>The Developers at the Door</h2>

      <p>You are standing in an open field west of a white house. The house is a carefully constructed masterpiece, with solid foundations, a beautiful facade matched by an elegant interior.</p>
      <p>In fact, the house is such a masterpiece that an endless line of volunteers has taken the time to help you improve upon it.</p>
      <p>There are two mailboxes here.</p>
      <p>The first is mysteriously labeled <em>Pull Requests</em>.</p>
      <p>The second is simply labeled <em>issues</em> ("as if I don't have enough of those to deal with", you think to yourself).</p>
      <p>Both are overflowing.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To organize the <em>issues</em> box, <a href="#" class="page-turner" data-target-page="37">turn to page 37</a>.</li>
        <li>To organize the <em>pull requests</em> box, <a href="#" class="page-turner" data-target-page="75">turn to page 75</a>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Bottomless</h2>
      <img src="img/451px-Maelstrom-Clarke.jpg">
      <p>You take a deep breath and open the box labeled <em>issues</em>.</p>
      <p>The size of the box surprises you. As you look into it, you are suddenly gripped by a feeling that the box has no bottom.</p>
      <p>As you stare down into the seemingly bottomless pit of the box, you begin to feel a chill running down your spine. It is as ifâ€¦ as if the endless box of issues is staring right back into your soul.</p>
      <p>It feels judgy.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rolling up your sleeves, you decide to take charge of the <em>issues</em> box and <a href="#" class="page-turner" data-target-page="38">turn to page 38</a>.</li>
        <li>Fear overtakes you. You close the box with a high pitched yelp and <a href="#" class="page-turner" data-target-page="1">turn to page 1</a>.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

      <p>As you reach down into the box, patterns begin to form.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Accept both <em>bug reports</em> and proposals for <em>new features, improvements and changes</em>. <a href="#" class="page-turner" data-target-page="39">turn to page 39</a>.</li>
        <li>Accept <em>bug reports</em>. <a href="#" class="page-turner" data-target-page="41">turn to page 41</a>.</li>
        <li>Accept proposals for <em>new features, improvements and changes</em>. <a href="#" class="page-turner" data-target-page="22">turn to page 22</a>.</li>
